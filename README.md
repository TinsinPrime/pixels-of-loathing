# Pixels of Loathing
*"Call me a shave and a haircut how I'm two bits."*

Pixels of Loathing is a 2-bit pixel art recreation/reimagining of Kingdom of Loathing, usable as a tileset in KoL Mafia!

### Installation
Step 1: Extract the zip file into the root folder of Mafia, overwriting any images it warns you about.  
Step 2: There is no step two! Installation is complete. If you already had Mafia open in browser, close the entire window and relaunch the relay browser. In my experience, this refreshes the image cache. Maybe. I'm not entirely sure *what* it does, but it certainly seems to make it work, so!  

### Uninstallation
Step 1: Delete any of the modified files you no longer want.
Step 2: Launch Mafia. It should redownload everything! I think?
